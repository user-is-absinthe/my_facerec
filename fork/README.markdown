## Documentation ##

You can find the documentation in the `doc` folder coming with this project. I have added the build html folder to 
the repository, so you don't need to build it by yourself. But if you want to build the documentation by yourself,
here is how to do it.

I've uploaded the documentation to my website, if you just want to view the documentation without cloning the repository:

## Old Documentation ##

I've appended the old documentation, so people can also read this without visiting other pages.

### A simple example for beginners

Due to popular request, I've created a simple example for getting started with the facerec framework.

#### Getting the data right 

We aren't doing a toy example, so you'll need some image data. For sake of simplicity I have assumed, that the images (the faces, persons you want to recognize) are given in folders. So imagine I have a folder `images` (the dataset!), with the subfolders person1, person2 and so on:

```
philipp@mango:~/facerec/data/images$ tree -L 2 | head -n 20
.
|-- person1
|   |-- 1.jpg
|   |-- 2.jpg
|   |-- 3.jpg
|   |-- 4.jpg
|-- person2
|   |-- 1.jpg
|   |-- 2.jpg
|   |-- 3.jpg
|   |-- 4.jpg

[...]
```

One of the public available datasets, that is already coming in such a folder structure is the AT&T Facedatabase, available at:

* [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html)

Once unpacked it is going to look like this (on my filesystem it is unpacked to /home/philipp/facerec/data/at/, your path is different!):

```
philipp@mango:~/facerec/data/at$ tree .
.
|-- README
|-- s1
|   |-- 1.pgm
|   |-- 2.pgm
[...]
|   `-- 10.pgm
|-- s2
|   |-- 1.pgm
|   |-- 2.pgm
[...]
|   `-- 10.pgm
|-- s3
|   |-- 1.pgm
|   |-- 2.pgm
[...]
|   `-- 10.pgm

...

40 directories, 401 files
```

That's all that needs to be done.

#### Example: Fisherfaces

The following code listing now will learn a Fisherfaces model on the AT&T Facedatabase. I wrote a simple method `read_images`, which reads the images from a given path (and optionally resizes them). Make sure you have the folder structured as described above. The `read_images` method returns [X,y] being:

* **X**: A list of NumPy arrays (images).
* **y**: A list of integers (corresponding labels).

The source code listing is also in this github repository at:

* [facerec/py/apps/scripts/simple_example.py](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/apps/scripts/simple_example.py)

#### Results

Since the AT&T Facedatabase is a fairly easy database we have got a `95.5%` recognition rate with the Fisherfaces method (with a 10-fold cross validation):

And we can have a look at the Fisherfaces found by the model:

![fisherfaces_at](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/raw/master/py/apps/scripts/fisherfaces_at.png "fisherfaces_at")

### Advanced Examples: Building your own PredictableModel

Basically all face recognition algorithms are the combination of a [feature extraction](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/feature.py)
and a [classifier](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/classifier.py). The Eigenfaces method for example is a Principal Component Analysis with a Nearest Neighbor classifier. Local Binary Patterns Histograms . The feature (which must be an [AbstractFeature](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/feature.py)) and the classifier (which must be an [AbstractClassifier](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/classifier.py)) form a [PredictableModel](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/model.py), which does the feature extraction and learns the classifier.

So if you want to use the Fisherfaces method for feature extraction you would do:

```
from facerec.feature import Fisherfaces
from facerec.classifier import NearestNeighbor
from facerec.model import PredictableModel

model = PredictableModel(Fisherfaces(), NearestNeighbor())
```

Once you have created your model you can call `compute(data,labels)` to learn it on given image `data` and their labels. There's nothing like a Dataset structure I enforce: You pass the images as a list of NumPy arrays (or something that could be converted into NumPy arrays), the labels are again a NumPy arrays of integer numbers (corresponding to a person).

```python

def read_images(path, sz=None):
    """Reads the images in a given folder, resizes images on the fly if size is given.

    Args:
        path: Path to a folder with subfolders representing the subjects (persons).
        sz: A tuple with the size Resizes 

    Returns:
        A list [X,y]

            X: The images, which is a Python list of numpy arrays.
            y: The corresponding labels (the unique number of the subject, person) in a Python list.
    """
    c = 0
    X,y = [], []
    for dirname, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(path):
        for subdirname in dirnames:
            subject_path = os.path.join(dirname, subdirname)
            for filename in os.listdir(subject_path):
                try:
                    im = Image.open(os.path.join(subject_path, filename))
                    im = im.convert("L")
                    # resize to given size (if given)
                    if (sz is not None):
                        im = im.resize(self.sz, Image.ANTIALIAS)
                    X.append(np.asarray(im, dtype=np.uint8))
                    y.append(c)
                except IOError, (errno, strerror):
                    print "I/O error({0}): {1}".format(errno, strerror)
                except:
                    print "Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0]
                    raise
            c = c+1
    return [X,y]
```

Reading in the image data is then as easy as calling:
```python
# Read in the image data:
[X,y] = read_images("/path/to/your/image/data")
```
#### Learning a Model

You can then learn a model by calling `compute` on it. You have to pass the image data in a list `X` and the according labels in a list `y`:

```
# Then compute the model:
model.compute(X,y)
# ...
```

#### Getting a prediction

Since I can't assume a standard classifier output, a classifier always outputs a list with:

```
[ predicted_label, generic_classifier_output]
```

Take the k-Nearest Neighbor for example. Imagine I have a 3-Nearest Neighbor classifier, then your PredictableModel is going to return something similar to:

```
>>> model.predict(X)
[ 0, 
  { 'labels'    : [ 0,      0,      1      ],
    'distances' : [ 10.132, 10.341, 13.314 ]
  }
]
```

In this example the predicted label is `0`, because two of three nearest neighbors were of label `0` and only one neighbor was `1`. The generic output is given in a dict for these classifiers, so you are given some semantic information. I prefer this over plain Python lists, because it is probably hard to read through some code, if you are accessing stuff by indices only.

If you only want to know the predicted label for a query image `X` you would write:

```
predicted_label = model.predict(X)[0]
```

And if you want to make your `PredictableModel` more sophisticated, by rejecting examples based on the classifier output for example, then you'll need to access the generic classifier output:

```
prediction = model.predict(X)
predicted_label = prediction[0]
generic_classifier_output = prediction[1]
```

You have to read up the classifier output in the help section of each classifers predict method.

#### Thresholding

In OpenCV you can pass a decision threshold to the predict method, which a prediction is thresholded against. So how can you introduce a decision threshold in the facerec framework? I admit there isn't a convenient or obvious way to do so, but it's actually quite easy. Imagine your classifier is 1-Nearest Neighbor, then a prediciton is going to yield something like this:

```
>>> prediction = model.predict(X)
[ 0,
   { 'labels'    : [ 0 ],
     'distances' : [ 12.345 ]
   }
]
```

Where

```
prediction[0]    -- Is the predicted label.
prediction[1]   -- is the generic classifier output, the decision is based on.
```

Now let's say you have estimated, that every distance above `10.1` is nonsense and should be ignored. Then you could do something like this in your script, to threshold against the given value:

```python
# This gets you the output:
prediction = model.predict(X)
predicted_label = prediction[0]
classifier_output = prediction[1]
# Now let's get the distance from the assuming a 1-Nearest Neighbor.
# Since it's a 1-Nearest Neighbor only look take the zero-th element:
distance = classifier_output['distances'][0]
# Now you can easily threshold by it:
if distance > 10.0:
  print "Unknown Person!"
else
  print "Person is known with label %i" % (predicted_label) 
```

#### Image processing chains

Sometimes it's also necessary to perform preprocessing on your images. This framework is quite advanced and makes it easy to experiment with algorithms. You can achieve image processing chains by using the [ChainOperator](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/operators.py). The ChainOperator computes a `feature1` and passes its output to a `feature2`. See the implementation of the `ChainOperator`, which is a `FeatureOperator`. The `FeatureOperator` in turn is an `AbstractFeature` again, so it can be the input for another `AbstractFeature`. Get it?

```python

class FeatureOperator(AbstractFeature):
	"""
	A FeatureOperator operates on two feature models.
	
	Args:
		model1 [AbstractFeature]
		model2 [AbstractFeature]
	"""
	def __init__(self,model1,model2):
		if (not isinstance(model1,AbstractFeature)) or (not isinstance(model2,AbstractFeature)):
			raise Exception("A FeatureOperator only works on classes implementing an AbstractFeature!")
		self.model1 = model1
		self.model2 = model2
	
	def __repr__(self):
		return "FeatureOperator(" + repr(self.model1) + "," + repr(self.model2) + ")"
		
class ChainOperator(FeatureOperator):
	"""
	The ChainOperator chains two feature extraction modules:
		model2.compute(model1.compute(X,y),y)
	Where X can be generic input data.
	
	Args:
		model1 [AbstractFeature]
		model2 [AbstractFeature]
	"""
	def __init__(self,model1,model2):
		FeatureOperator.__init__(self,model1,model2)
		
	def compute(self,X,y):
		X = self.model1.compute(X,y)
		return self.model2.compute(X,y)
		
	def extract(self,X):
		X = self.model1.extract(X)
		return self.model2.extract(X)
	
	def __repr__(self):
		return "ChainOperator(" + repr(self.model1) + "," + repr(self.model2) + ")"
```

So imagine we want to perform a TanTriggs preprocessing, before applying the Fisherfaces. What you would do is using the output of the `TanTriggsPreprocessing` feature extraction as input for the `Fisherfaces` feature extraction. We can express this with a `ChainOperator` in facerec:

```
from facerec.preprocessing import TanTriggsPreprocessing
from facerec.feature import Fisherfaces
from facerec.operators import ChainOperator
from facerec.model import PredictableModel


feature = ChainOperator(TanTriggsPreprocessing(), Fisherfaces())
classifier = NearestNeighbor()
model = PredictableModel(feature, classifier)
```

#### Classifier

Start with a [Nearest Neighbor model](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/classifier.py) as a classifier. In its simplest form you would just need to write:

```
from facerec.classifier import NearestNeighbor

classifier = NearestNeighbor()
```

This creates a 1-Nearest Neighbor with the Euclidean Distance as distance metric. To create a 5-Nearest Neighbor with a Cosine Distance instead, you would write:

```
from facerec.classifier import NearestNeighbor
from facerec.distance import CosineDistance

classifier = NearestNeighbor(dist_metric=CosineDistance(), k=5)
```

If you want to build a `PredictableModel` to generate predictions, simply use the [PredictableModel](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/model.py):

```
from facerec.model import PredictableModel
from facerec.feature import Fisherfaces
from.facerec.classifier import NearestNeighbor
from facerec.distance import EuclideanDistance

feature = Fisherfaces()

classifier = NearestNeighbor(dist_metric=CosineDistance(), k=5)
predictor = PredictableModel(feature, classifier)
```

Once you have created your model you can call `compute` to learn it. Please see the [examples](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/tree/master/py/apps/).

### usage ###

The old script was hard to use and since the new one is easy to use I've called it ``simple_videofacerec.py``. Basically the script allows you to compute, save and load models for face recognition in videos (e.g. webcam feeds). Moreover you can optionally validate your model to see the performance you can expect. [OpenCV](http://www.opencv.org), which is a great Open Source project, is used for the face detection part and you can use all the available cascades coming with [OpenCV](http://www.opencv.org) for face detection.

Here is the usage and help message you get by calling ``simple_videofacerec.py -h``:

<pre>

  -v NUMFOLDS, --validate=NUMFOLDS
                        Performs a k-fold cross validation on the dataset, if

                        haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml).
</pre>

As you can see, the name for the recognition model (called ``model_filename`` above) is required. I don't think everything in the help message is self-explaining, so here is an in-depth summary:

In the script you can pass the size with the <code>-r</code> or <code>--resize</code> switch and the size in format <code>[width]x[height]</code>, so valid arguments are for example <code>70x70</code> or <code>130x100</code>.</td>

### working with the script ###

#### getting the image data right ####

All of my recent tutorials include the same part, that explains how to prepare the image data for my scripts. It's not because I love repeating myself, but because readers almost always ask this question, so I am copy and pasting it to avoid the confusion. For sake of simplicity I have assumed in the script, that the images (the *faces*, the *persons you want to recognize*) are given in folders. One folder per person. So imagine I have a folder (a dataset) called ``celebrities`` with the subfolders ``tom_hanks``, ``philipp_wagner``, ``angelina_jolie`` and so on. 

The folder (stored at ``~/facerec/data/celebrities`` in this example) will look like this

<pre>
philipp@mango:~/facerec/data/celebrities$ tree -L 2
.
|-- tom_hanks
|   |-- 1.jpg
|   |-- 2.jpg
|   |-- 3.jpg
|   |-- 4.jpg
...
|-- philipp_wagner
|   |-- 1.jpg
|   |-- 2.jpg
|   |-- 3.jpg
|   |-- 4.jpg
...
|-- angelina_jolie
|   |-- 1.jpg
|   |-- 2.jpg
|   |-- 3.jpg
|   |-- 4.jpg
[...]
</pre>

If you pass a dataset with a similar hierarchie to ``simple_videofacerec.py``, it is able to read the images and use the folder names for identification.

#### learning and validating a model ####

Imagine I have prepared some images of celebrities and stored them in ``/home/philipp/facerec/data/celebrities``, of course in the hierarchie as described above. The images are all aligned at the eyes, as most of the algorithms need aligned images to learn a good model, similar to my set of [George Clooney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney) images (he was so amazing in *Batman & Robin*!):

<img src="/static/images/blog/videofacerec/clooney_set.png" class="mediacenter" alt="aligned images" />

Initially you don't have a computed mode to perform the face recognition yet. This predicition model has to be trained on the set of images we've prepared. This is done by passing the ``-t`` or ``--train`` parameter, the path to our dataset (``/home/philipp/facerec/data/celebrities``) and the model filename (e.g. ``my_model.pkl) to the script. So you would start the script with the following call:

<pre>
python simple_videofacerec.py -t /home/philipp/facerec/data/celebrities my_model.pkl
</pre>

If you run the script, you'll see an output similar to this:

<pre>
philipp@mango:~/github/facerec/py/apps/videofacerec$ python simple_videofacerec.py -t /home/philipp/facerec/data/celebrities my_model.pkl

Press [ESC] to exit the program!
Script output:
Loading dataset...
Computing the model...
Saving the model...
Starting application...
</pre>

This line (1) reads the image data in the given folder, (2) computes the model, (3) saves the model to ``my_model.pkl`` and finally starts grabbing images from the webcam. And you can see, that Python serializes you the learnt model to disk:

<pre>
philipp@mango:~/github/facerec/py/apps/videofacerec$ du -sh my_model.pkl 
2.0M	my_model.pkl
</pre>

You can easily reuse the model and don't need to learn it from the dataset all over again. This can be done by simply don't passing the ``-t`` or ``--train`` parameter, but only passing the model filename:

<pre>
python simple_videofacerec.py my_model.pkl
</pre>

And the script output is much shorter:

<pre>
philipp@mango:~/github/facerec/py/apps/videofacerec$ python simple_videofacerec.py my_model.pkl

Press [ESC] to exit the program!
Script output:
Loading the model...
Starting application...
</pre>

#### validating the model ####

Sometimes you want to know, which performance to expect from the model given the data available. The script optionally performs a k-Fold Cross Validation to estimate the *precision* of the model. This is done by passing the ``-v`` or ``--validate`` switch with the number of folds as parameter. The validation is ignored, if it is not used with the ``-t`` or ``--train`` switch:

<pre>
python simple_videofacerec.py -t /home/philipp/facerec/data/celebrities -v 10 my_model.pkl
</pre>

The scripts output then includes some log output and prints the cross validation result:

<pre>
philipp@mango:~/github/facerec/py/apps/videofacerec$ python simple_videofacerec.py -t /home/philipp/facerec/data/celebrities -v 10 my_model.pkl

Usage: simple_videofacerec.py [options] model_filename

Press [ESC] to exit the program!

#### defining your own model ####

If you are experimenting with the framework, you probably don't want to stick to the [Fisherfaces](https://www.bytefish.de/blog/fisherfaces) algorithm used as default. Instead of coming up with an own language for defining a model or using a XML configuration (*please not!*), there's simply a method which returns the model definition. Sometimes a method is totally sufficient in programming:

```python
def get_model(image_size, subject_names):
    """ This method returns the PredictableModel which is used to learn a model
        for possible further usage. If you want to define your own model, this
        is the method to return it from!
    """
    # Define the Fisherfaces Method as Feature Extraction method:
    feature = Fisherfaces()
    # Define a 1-NN classifier with Euclidean Distance:
    classifier = NearestNeighbor(dist_metric=EuclideanDistance(), k=1)
    # Return the model as the combination:
    return ExtendedPredictableModel(feature=feature, classifier=classifier, image_size=image_size, subject_names=subject_names)
```

So if you want to define your own algorithms, this is place to overwrite. You need to return an ``ExtendedPredictableModel`` for the script to work (``ExtendedPredictableModel`` is defined in the script).

### conclusion ###

This was my first blog post for a long time, and I hope you had as much fun reading it as I had writing it. If there's anything you'd like to see in the script, then let me know and I'll be happy to add it. Before you comment below and ask about the recognition performance of the implemented algorithms: they do not work perfect on not preprocessed input images. In order to create a more robust recognition, your input images should be aligned in the same manner as we did for the training set.

Pose estimation is a topic far, far, far from being easy and covering it in the scope of this blog post is not possible. Some of the upcoming articles I am preparing will evaluate algorithms for head pose estimation and see how they enhance the overall recognition process. But I also need time to dig through current literature, prepare interesting experiments and finally write the article - this takes time!

For now I'd like to refer to the most interesting approach for object alignment I know of:
